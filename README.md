# Code-Refactor
​
The Horiseon website was built in a way that didnt conform to the standards set by The Americans with Disabilities Act. This act requires business to make accomidations for people with disabilities.

I refactored the application code to meet all of the requirements without changing the appearence of the website itself.
​
I reworked the HTML to include semantic HTML elements and that follow of logical structure independent of styling and positioning. Below is a detailed list of changes that I made to the HTML.

Changed title content to display on web page tab

Added Type ="text/ccs"

Changed div tag to header tag on line 13

Changed div tags to nav tags on lines 16 and 28

Changed div tag to main tag on line 33

Added alt & title for images on lines 36, 36, and 56

Changed div tag to aside tag on line 67

Changed div tag to article tag on lines 68, 75, and 82

Changed heart icon to HTML MarkUp code on line 93

For the CSS, I consolidated all of the selectors and properties and made them follow the semantic structure of the HTML. Below is a detailed list of the changes I made to the CSS.

Changed .header tag and applied to all header tags

Removed float right from line 63

Condensed in to groups on lines 87-89, 95-97, 103-105, 112-114, 124-126, and 131-133

I left comments on both the HTML and CSS pages to show the changes I made

​
All files have been uploaded to the github repository(see link below) and the application has been deployed to a live url using github page(see link below)

<p>
The application should load with no issues or errors
